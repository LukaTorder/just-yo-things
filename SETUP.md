## 🎯 Implementing Your Chase Logic

Open `src/components/SlugChaseLogic.tsx` and implement your algorithm:

```typescript
// Key things you'll need to calculate:
// 1. Slug's position relative to user
// 2. Slug's movement speed
// 3. Chase behavior (direct chase, prediction, etc.)
// 4. Distance calculations
// 5. Reward system (coins for distance/time)
```
